; bootrom for py65 monitor in 65Org16 mode
; based on
; Intel Hex format loader by Ross Archer (9 February 2001, freeware)
; from http: http://www.6502.org/source/monitors/intelhex/intelhex.htm
;

; use this monitor like this:
;   py65mon -m 65org16
;   load bootrom.bin fe00
;   goto fe00

START = $FFFFFe00

; I/O is memory-mapped in py65:
PUTC     = $f001
GETC     = $f004

; Note that Hex format for 65Org16 uses ';' not ':' as the start of record mark
; also note that some fields are now composed of 16-bit elements:
; previously:
;  length offset type   data     checksum
;     :/08/E008/00/08090A0B0C0D0E0F/xx
; now
;     ;/10/E008/00/00080009000A000B000C000D000E000F/xx

; Zero-page storage
DPL       =  $00 ; data pointer (two bytes) used by PUTSTRI
DPH       =  $01 ; high of data pointer
RECLEN    =  $02 ; record length in bytes
START_LO  =  $03
START_HI  =  $04
RECTYPE   =  $05
CHKSUM    =  $06 ; record checksum accumulator
DLFAIL    =  $07 ; flag for download failure
TEMP      =  $08 ; save hex value
TMPHEX    =  $09 ; save another hex value

	; where the RAM program MUST have its first instruction
ENTRY_POINT  =  $0200
