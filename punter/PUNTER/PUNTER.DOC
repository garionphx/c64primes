 Punter Protocol 1.04        I. Basic Overview                              2
 ============================================================================
  
      This new protocol standard for the IBM has been implemented to allow
 greater compatibility of IBM and Commodore machines.  Since Punter has been
 a standard on the Commodore for years, it has become customary for Commodore
 owners to use this reliable protocol.  This protocol offers a bridge between
 Commodore and IBM machines.
  
  
 1. Shareware Contract
 ---------------------
  
      Please feel free to implement this external protocol in your bulletin
 board system or on your favorite terminal, but please note that this
 software is by no means free.  It is the result of dedicated time and hard
 work.  Please support the programmers in their endeavors to bring you low-
 cost, quality software.  As you will note, the registration fee is quite
 reasonable.  This program is a part of Data Technology Corporation's new
 shareware or user-supported program.  It is designed to offer new software
 to the consumer on a trial basis.  If you do not feel that the software
 meets your needs within a 30-day period, you obviously will not be required
 to register, however, if you do use this product, please register and
 support the programmers that have brought you this quality software.  Also,
 you are encouraged to distribute the shareware product as you wish as long
 as no part of the program or documentation has been altered.
  
  
 2. System Requirements
 ----------------------
  
      This program has been designed to run on the IBM Personal Computer and
 compatible PC clones.  This program is only guaranteed to run under
 Microsoft DOS or IBM Personal Computer DOS on an IBM PC, XT, AT, or 100%
 Compatible Clone, although it may run on a variety of systems.
  
 Basic System Requirements:
  
   - IBM PC/XT/AT (Or Compatible Clone)
   - 64K RAM
   - Serial/Asynchronous Port (COM1 - COM4)
   - Modem/Null Modem
   - 1 Double Density Disk Drive or Better
  
 The system described above will allow you to run the protocol, but you will
 most probably need a communications package or bulletin board system to
 fully utilize the protocol.  Memory requirements will increase well above
 64K when a communications program is installed.  A Modem is required if you
 wish to transfer data with dial-up systems.  However, if you only wish to
 transfer data between computers, a null modem (basically an interconnecting
 cable between serial ports) will be required.  You will also need some sort
 of recording media for the program and files to be sent or received.  A
 single-sided, double-density disk is the basic requirement.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


 ============================================================================
 Punter Protocol 1.04          II. Installation                             3
 ============================================================================
  
      Installation of this protocol is pretty straightforward.  You will be
 required to do the following steps:
  
      - Copy the program "PUNTER.EXE" (Included With This Documentation) to
        the desired diskette or directory where you will execute it.  If you
        want, you may make a special directory for this purpose.  If you do
        not know how to do this, please consult you DOS documentation.
  
      - If you wish, you may also have a directory for uploads, and a
        directory for downloads.  If you have a diskette based system, you
        must either use the same diskette with the program on it, or use
        another diskette if you have more than one drive.  It will be
        explained how you can do this for either system.
  
      - You may also be required to set up batch files for your specific
        system.  It will be explained later how to create batch files for
        your needs.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


 ============================================================================
 Punter Protocol 1.04             III. Setup                                4
 ============================================================================
  
      The following information is designed to help you get the protocol
 working on your system.  It will center on specific requirements and
 needs of the user.  Examples will also be provided so that you may see how
 to install the program.
  
  
 1. Execution
 ------------
  
      To execute the protocol, you will need to look at your system and
 requirements.  On many systems, you will be required to make a batch file so
 a bulletin board system or communications package will be able to utilize
 the protocol correctly.  Examples for Procomm Plus and Telix will be
 provided since they are the most prominent packages.  If you wish to install
 it on a bulletin board system, please consult the documentation for
 installation of external protocols.
  
  
 2. Options
 ----------
      In order to get a list of the command line parameters that the protocol
 will accept, type the name "PUNTER" at the prompt with no command line
 parameters.  Make sure that the program "PUNTER.EXE" is on the current disk
 and in the current directory.
  
   You type:
  
      Punter <return>
  
   It responds:
  
      Punter* Protocol Ver. 1.04
      (C)Copyright 1989
      Data Technology Corporation
      All Rights Reserved.
  
      * MS-DOS Implementation of Steve
      Punter's Original "C1" Protocol.
  
      USAGE:
      PUNTER [S] [R] [Z<BlockSize>] [P<PortNum>] [B<BaudRate>] FileName
  
      Command Line Parameters:
      S - Send Punter
      R - Receive Punter
      P - Define Port Number (1-4)
      B - Define Baud Rate (300-115200)
      Z - Maximum Block Size (40-255)
  
      The last command line parameter will always be the filename.
  
      Transfer Aborted.
      Exit Code: 1
  
 This shows you the possible combinations in which you may use the protocol.
 Each command line parameter must be explained.
  
  
 The "S" or "SEND" command line parameter tells the protocol that it will be
 sending a file rather than receiving one.  If you are sending a file, this


 ============================================================================
 Punter Protocol 1.04             III. Setup                                5
 ============================================================================
  
 is a required command line parameter.  To use this parameter, you will be
 required to execute the file like this:
  
      PUNTER S <Other Parameters Will Follow>
  
 This will initiate the protocol and put it in send mode.
  
  
 The "R" or "RECEIVE" command line parameter tells the protocol that it will
 be receiving a file rather than sending one.  If you are receiving a file,
 this is a required command line parameter.  To use this parameter you will
 be required to execute the file line this:
  
      PUNTER R <Other Parameters Will Follow>
  
 This will initiate the protocol and put it in receive mode.
  
  
 The "P" or "DEFINE PORT NUMBER" parameter defines the communications port
 that the protocol will attempt to use.  The current implementation of this
 protocol supports communications ports one through four. (COM1 - COM4)
 Please consult the documentation for your serial port if you are not sure
 the number of your communications port.  On many serial ports you will be
 required to SET the communications port number with DIP switches or jumpers.
 If you are installing you serial port for the first time, it is suggested
 that you use COM1 or COM2 since they are the most compatible settings.  To
 set up the protocol to send a file using COM2 or port number two, you must
 execute the file like this:
  
      PUNTER S P2 <Other Parameters Will Follow>
  
 If you are planning to use COM1, you will not be required to include this
 command line parameter.  The protocol will assume that you are using COM1.
  
  
 The "B" or "DEFINE BAUD RATE" parameter specifies the baud rate at which you
 want the protocol to run.  You may have baud rates from 300 to 115200 baud.
 Your serial port and modem must both be able to support the specified baud
 rate.  To set the protocol to receive a file at 1200 baud, execute the
 program like this:
  
      PUNTER R B1200 <Other Parameters Will Follow>
  
 If you wish, you may not include this parameter.  If you do not include the
 baud rate parameter, the protocol will use the baud rate that the serial
 port was previously initialized to.  If the port has not already been
 initialized, it is suggested that you use this parameter.
  
  
 The "Z" or "DEFINE MAX BLOCK SIZE" parameter tells the protocol the maximum
 block size to use.  This is the number of bytes that the protocol will send
 in each "packet" of data.  If line conditions are good, you will most likely
 use a large block size since the transfer will be much faster.  However, if
 line conditions are bad, a small block size should be used to increase
 reliability.  For most purposes, a large block size will do!  Allowed block
 sizes are 40 to 255 bytes per block.  This parameter only has meaning when
 you are sending a file.  If you are receiving a file, the SENDER will decide
 the proper block size.  To send a file with 100 bytes per block, do the
 following:
  


 ============================================================================
 Punter Protocol 1.04             III. Setup                                6
 ============================================================================
  
      PUNTER S Z100 <Other Parameters Will Follow>
  
 For most purposes you will use a block size of 255 since it is the fastest.
 If you wish to use a block size of 255, you will not be required to include
 this parameter since it defaults to a block size of 255 bytes per block.
  
  
 The "FILENAME" parameter defines the file that is to be received or sent.
 This parameter is MANDATORY.  If you fail to include a file to be sent or
 received, the transfer will be aborted.  You may also specify a drive and
 directory with the filename if the file is not in the current directory or
 on the current drive.  To send a file called "FILE.ARC" on drive D in the
 directory "\UPLOADS," do the following:
  
      PUNTER S D:\UPLOADS\FILE.ARC
  
 As you can see, the drive letter comes first, the directory comes second,
 and the actual filename comes last.  To receive a file called "THISFILE.ARC"
 and place it in the current directory, do the following:
  
      PUNTER R THISFILE.ARC
  
 This will place the file in the current directory on the current drive.  If
 you wish to have the file placed on a different drive and retain the drive's
 current directory, only specify the drive like this:
  
      PUNTER R D:THISFILE.ARC
  
 This will put the file "THISFILE" on drive D in its current directory.
  
  
 3. Uploading and Downloading
 ----------------------------
  
      If you are running under a system that uploads and downloads, you will
 be required (in many instances) to create a batch file to process special
 data that is sent by the main program.  You will need a separate file for
 uploading and downloading.  Procomm Plus (a very popular communications
 package) would use the following batch file for downloading:
  
      PUNTER R P2 %1
  
 The "%1" is the filename that will be provided by the communications
 package.  As you can see, the port is set to use COM2.  The batch file for
 uploading would look like this:
  
      PUNTER S P2 %1
  
 The "%1" again is the filename that will be provided by the communications
 package.  If you wished to use a port besides COM2, you would simply specify
 a different port number.
  
 On Telix, the program also will send the port and baud rate.  Although, as
 mentioned earlier, the baud rate will default to the last baud rate used, it
 is sometimes good to specify the baud rate.  The following batch file would
 handle downloading on Telix 3.11:
  
      PUNTER R P%2 B%1 %3
  
 The %2 would be the port as sent by the package, the %1 would be the baud


 ============================================================================
 Punter Protocol 1.04             III. Setup                                7
 ============================================================================
  
 rate, and the %3 would be the specified filename.  For uploading, you would
 use the following batch file:
  
      PUNTER S P%2 B%1 %3
  
 Again, the %1, %2, and %3 would be the specified parameters as sent by the
 terminal.
  
 A test upload in direct mode or with your batch file should yield the
 following if you send the file D:\MODEM\PUNTER.ARC:
  
      Punter Send Session Beginning.
      Drive: D:
      Path: \MODEM
      File: PUNTER.ARC
      Communications Port: 1
      Baud Rate: 1200
      Block Size: 255
  
 If a carrier has been established, the following will also be displayed:
  
      File Size: 21561
      Est. Time: 5 Min(s)
  
 Certain parameters will vary under certain conditions.
  
  
 3. ERRORLEVELs
 --------------
  
      Depending on the result of the send or receive session, DOS's
 ERRORLEVEL parameter will be set.  If the transfer is successful, then the
 ERRORLEVEL will be set to 0.  If it is unsuccessful, it will be set to 1.
 These are the standard settings for most systems that utilize ERRORLEVELs to
 find out if the transfer was successful or not.
